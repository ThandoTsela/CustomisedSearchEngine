# GoogleFlaskApp
A website with built-in search functionality. This web application is connected with **Google Search Engine API** to get the search response from Google and then display it on our application.

It has been customized to search for results within the Richmond VA area.

From the Google Search Engine API we collect only the title, snippet, and the URL to display on our website.

After displaying the results, they are stored on a **Firebase database**.
